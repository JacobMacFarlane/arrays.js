1. Im feeling pretty good with arrays so far. There is a lot of different information to learn but the more i deal with them and talk it out as i go the more i will understand
2. I wish i could grasp all the different commands i could do dealing with arrays immeditaly, but like i said in answer one i will just learn and catch on as i go
3. the only question i have would be what is the fastest way to learn all the different array methods? Would i just benefit from writing all of them down and having them near my computer?
